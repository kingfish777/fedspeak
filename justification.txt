Doooooooooooyyyyyyyyyyy ... ---> just like the Saudis and the Avigdor Liebermans and Prescott Bushes and Tollivers (of Deadwood fame) of this world, the lizard brained owners of this planet have to invest billions of dollars in rhetorical strategy to tame and cajole the fact that they themselves and their preferred policies and the life circumstances of their subjects are somehow, for whatever reason deeply unpopular. What prevents us from doing anything about it is 1.) the incredible effectiveness of frame-based rhetorical (logos, ethos, pathos) strategies of their propaganda (see Frank Luntz, George Lakoff, Aristotle), 2.) mutual reinforcement of propaganda messages in the police (testifying again to its efficacy), 3.) intellectual/social inertia, and 4.) fatigue of the poor working and would-be middle classes from just holding on to their station and not slipping further into the cracks of penury and dissipation. 


my mom of the Fox News generation: "Who knows what The Truth is. Do you know? Bill O'Reilly has made sense out of life and, furthermore, both he and your step-father/Father, rather, make love to me each and every night." Laugh and live a little. You can't control anything that goes on. Don't worry that cortisol from the stress of being at the bottom of the human foodchain has made you obese and your psychiatrist is threatening to take away ADHD medications because your blood pressure is too high because even though you put in 50 hours/week and get paid for 40 and you will never ever get a raise and you will get fired if you can't focus. Just. Be. Light. And. Care. Free!!!! Get rid of the estate tax. Oh yeah, son, most of all, REMEMBER BENGHAZI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
