Doooooooooooyyyyyyyyyyy ... ---> just like the Saudis and the Avigdor Liebermans and Prescott Bushes and Tollivers (of Deadwood fame) of this world, the lizard brained owners of this planet have to invest billions of dollars in rhetorical strategy to tame and cajole the fact that they themselves and their preferred policies and the life circumstances of their subjects are somehow, for whatever reason deeply unpopular. What prevents us from doing anything about it is 1.) the incredible effectiveness of frame-based rhetorical (logos, ethos, pathos) strategies of their propaganda (see Frank Luntz, George Lakoff, Aristotle), 2.) mutual reinforcement of propaganda messages in the police (testifying again to its efficacy), 3.) intellectual/social inertia, and 4.) fatigue of the poor working and would-be middle classes from just holding on to their station and not slipping further into the cracks of penury and dissipation.
