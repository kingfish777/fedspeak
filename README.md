Fedspeak/Greenspeak Definition: 
	“Language of purposeful obfuscation to avoid certain questions coming up where saying 'no comment' is in 
 	 fact an answer. So I proceed with 4 or 5 sentences which become increasingly obscure and the Senator 
	 thinks his questions has been answered.” 
                  - Alan Greenspan, somewhere on youtube
